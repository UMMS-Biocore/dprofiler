Description: Dprofiler computationally profiles a set of targeted samples by connecting them to reference expression datasets with phenotypic profiles of interest. 
             Building on these reference profiles of phenotypic groups, Dprofiler evaluates bulk RNA samples, detect possibly existing anomalies and heterogeneities, and 
             further explores causes and sources of distinct molecular patterns with the aid of single cell maps and other reference gene expression datasets.
