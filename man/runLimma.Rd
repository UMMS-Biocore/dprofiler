\usage{
runLimma(data = NULL, columns = NULL, conds = NULL, params = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix that includes all the expression raw counts, rownames has to be the gene, isoform or region names/IDs.}

\item{columns}{is a vector that includes the columns that are going to be analyzed. These columns has to match with the given data.}

\item{conds}{experimental conditions. The order has to match with the column order}

\item{params}{normfact: Calculate normalization factors to scale the raw library sizes. Values can be "TMM","RLE","upperquartile","none". fitType, fitting method; "ls" for least squares or "robust" for robust regression normBet: Normalizes expression intensities so that the intensities or log-ratios have similar distributions across a set of arrays. datatype: suggest if the data is a count data or not.}
}
\description{
Run Limma algorithm on the selected conditions. Output is to be used for the interactive display.
Adapted from debrowser::runLimma(), a version for non-count RNA data (microarray)
